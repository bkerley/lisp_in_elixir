# LispInElixir

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bkerley/lisp_in_elixir.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bkerley/lisp_in_elixir)

I had a day of air travel ahead of me and decided to implement a LISP in Elixir,
based on Peter Norvig's
["(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))"][norvig], with tweaks
and changes necessary to make it work in Elixir.

## Installation

Just clone it. I don't intend to release this in a useful form for
anything but learning by reading the source and a bit of playing with it.
